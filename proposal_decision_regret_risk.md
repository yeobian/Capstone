# Capstone Project Proposal  
## Decision Regret Risk Estimation Using Public Economic Data

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Individuals frequently make purchasing and financial decisions that they later regret, often under similar conditions such as pricing, timing, and location. These repeated suboptimal decisions are not necessarily caused by a lack of information, but by difficulty contextualizing individual choices within broader economic and consumer behavior patterns. Currently, there is no accessible, data-driven tool that helps individuals assess whether a given decision aligns with historically regret-prone conditions.

---

## 2. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning–based web application that estimates the likelihood of post-decision regret by comparing user decision inputs with historical public economic and consumer data. The system is intended to support informed decision-making by highlighting statistically unfavorable conditions rather than prescribing or enforcing specific actions.

## 3. Machine Learning Task

**Prediction Task:**  
Given a set of decision conditions (such as product category, price level, geographic region, and timing), the model predicts a **regret risk score** that represents how frequently similar decisions have been associated with negative outcomes or economic inefficiency in historical data.

This system focuses on probabilistic pattern recognition and risk estimation rather than classifying decisions as correct or incorrect.

## 4. Data Sources

The project will utilize publicly available and aggregated datasets, including:

- Consumer Price Index (CPI) data  
- Consumer expenditure and spending trend data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  
- Regional price variation and cost-of-living data  
- Public consumer behavior and economic trend datasets  

All data sources are anonymized, publicly accessible, and ethically sourced.

---

## 5. Web Application Description

The web-based application will allow users to:

- Input decision parameters such as price, category, and location  
- Receive a regret risk score based on historical economic patterns  
- View visual comparisons to regional and temporal benchmarks  
- Explore contextual explanations (e.g., price deviations from regional averages)

The interface is designed to emphasize transparency and user understanding rather than automated recommendations.

## 6. Ethical Considerations

This project does not evaluate individuals or personal outcomes. No personally identifiable information will be collected. All outputs are probabilistic and informational in nature, designed to provide context rather than judgment or prescription.

---

## 7. Expected Impact

By transforming public economic data into an interpretable decision-support tool, this project demonstrates how machine learning can reduce repeated suboptimal decision-making and improve consumer awareness. Potential applications include financial literacy tools, consumer protection platforms, and personal finance technologies.
