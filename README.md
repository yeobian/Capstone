# Capstone
This is for my Capstone project
# Interpersonal Risk Pattern Awareness Tool

## Overview
This project is a machine learning–based web application designed to improve user awareness of potentially harmful interpersonal dynamics. Rather than diagnosing individuals or labeling relationships, the system compares anonymized, scenario-based user inputs with empirically documented interpersonal risk patterns derived from publicly available research data.

The goal is to demonstrate how public data and machine learning can be responsibly applied to support awareness, education, and informed decision-making in sensitive social contexts.

## Problem Statement
Many individuals experience harmful interpersonal patterns but struggle to recognize early warning signs due to emotional involvement, normalization of behavior, or lack of accessible, evidence-based tools. Existing resources are often retrospective, qualitative, or difficult to apply to real-life situations.

There is a need for a data-driven, educational tool that helps users contextualize their experiences by comparing them with patterns identified in large-scale, publicly available research datasets.

---

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a web-based system that:
- Uses machine learning to analyze anonymized interpersonal scenarios
- Provides a **pattern similarity score** based on established research
- Emphasizes awareness and education rather than judgment or diagnosis

This project prioritizes ethical design and transparency.

---

## Machine Learning Approach
The core ML task is a pattern similarity and risk awareness model:

**Input**
- Anonymized, scenario-based text descriptions or selected behavioral indicators

**Output**
- A probabilistic pattern similarity score indicating how closely the input aligns with documented interpersonal risk patterns found in public research data

The model does not identify, diagnose, or classify individuals.

---

## Data Sources
All data used in this project is publicly available and ethically sourced, including:
- CDC and NIH survey datasets related to interpersonal behavior and well-being
- Public social science and psychology research datasets
- Aggregated and anonymized legal or social survey data where applicable

No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored.

---

## Web Application Features
The web application allows users to:
- Select or describe anonymized interpersonal scenarios
- Receive a research-based pattern similarity score
- View visual explanations of relevant behavioral patterns
- Access educational resources and external support information

The interface is designed to prioritize clarity, transparency, and user agency.

---

## Ethical Considerations
This project was designed with strict ethical safeguards:
- This tool does **not** diagnose individuals or label relationships
- No personal identifiers or real names are collected
- Outputs are probabilistic and research-based, not definitive judgments
- The application is intended for educational and awareness purposes only

---

## Impact
This project demonstrates how machine learning and publicly available data can be used responsibly to address complex social challenges. By translating academic research into an accessible awareness tool, it highlights the role of ethical ML systems in supporting informed decision-making.
